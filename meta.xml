DESCRIPTION:
Creates a different experience when
logging into your account. Instead
of using a password with unicode
characters you use numbers instead
by a keypad system similar to applications
such as key less doorlocks and such.

This actually lowers security however
the main challenge is to highten the security
by using some algorithm that converts the
numbers into ASCII and hash them with salt.
